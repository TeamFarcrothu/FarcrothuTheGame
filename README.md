TODO:

Till next project defence:

- move lists with enemy, asteroids and all other static lists to GameEngine - done
- instead of cleaning lists with present enemies, asteroids, bullets and etc. after they are dead or out of screen, set their vertical position at 0 to -300 - maybe not needed?
- add more types of enemy ships/bosses
- add collectable items - done

Other things to do:

- methods to all classes: (names may change due to better idea or functionality)
	- entity.Die()
	- entity.AddScore()
	- entity.Restart/Reposition()
- input handler class - done
- game level class


More to come :)
